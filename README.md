# Linux_Shell
In this Project, I have used standard C libraries, including Linux system calls such as fork(), exec() family system calls and wait() family of system calls to build a "Shell" (a command line interface to users to type commands in).

Internal Commands Handled :-
1. cd
2. echo
3. pwd

External Commands Handled :-
1. ls
2. cat
3. date
4. rm
5. mkdir

Few options for all the Commands have been handled & Error Handling has also been done.
